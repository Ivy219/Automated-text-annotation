# Automated-text-annotation

## Project heading: Experiments with automated text annotation libraries

Description: There are a number of interesting ways to annotate or add information to texts (e.g. tagging named entities, labelling text with sentiment or semantic categories). This short project will involve finding Python code to apply new and interesting models/techniques to annotate text. 

Some examples:  
* Empath (Ejhfast/empath-client: analyze text with empath) - assigns semantic labels to texts based on a dictionary extracted from a word embedding model.  
* BERTopic - which approaches topic modelling as a clustering and labelling problem.  
* SaysWho · spaCy Universe - check out the Spacy Universe for other Spacy-compatible libraries - this one identifies quotes and who said them   
* aspect-based-sentiment-analysis · PyPI - aspect-based sentiment analysis attempts to find the sentiment about particular concepts or things in the text (don't know anything about this but looks interesting).  
* Docuscope - https://docuscospacy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docuscope.html  

Places to look are Hugging Face, Github, Pypi (repository of pip installable libraries), Kaggle and academic papers.  

I'm particularly interested in Argumentation/Argument Mining or machine learning approaches to describe the structure of texts and any models or code you can find to assist with this. I'm happy for you to do some research on aspect-based sentiment analysis approaches and if there are any good pre-trained models or approaches.  

So, the task is to find some different interesting libraries and get Python code working (hopefully they have some examples you can make use of). You will produce a Github repository with some different Python notebooks and working examples. I can show you how to use Github for this and that is a good skill for you to develop. It will be fine to use notebooks that various projects make available, you don't have to create the code from scratch. It is fine to use generative AI to assist you with the code examples if needed.  

You mentioned about fine-tuning a large-language model - I'll find a way we can apply this.
