Letter of the week P.C. Laird, Milford
It is often claimed that climate scientists disagree over the issue of global warming. Yet a recent article by NASA states that multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 per cent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree that human activity is causing climate warming. Recent research quoted in Scientific American on all global climate models published from the 1970s to 2007 concludes: “Even models in the 1970s accurately predicted the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature rise ... Most of these models are long since obsolete, replaced by far more advanced generations ... yet, most of them were spot on. Fourteen out of 17 models were found to be accurate.”
But will this change the views of global warming sceptics. Sadly, the answer is “no”. People who would rush to have a medical procedure for some potentially fatal disease like cancer, if advised by 97 per cent of medical specialists, will remain in a state of denial because any evidence is trumped by the economic bottom line. And yet without urgent action, economic performance itself will be swamped by climate change.
