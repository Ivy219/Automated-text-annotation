Stark images of extreme weather, wildlife in decline and pollution were accompanied by images of hope and nature recovery in the Campaign for National Parks’ (CNP) Photography Competition 2021.
This year’s competition, in the run-up to COP26, focused on documenting climate change in national parks in the UK, attracting entries from across England and Wales, showing both the impact of climate change and the work under way to address this.
Shaun Davey won over the judges with a stunning image (right) of a sunset on Porlock Marsh in Exmoor National Park to be crowned overall winner.
“The marsh is only 25 years old; it was previously agricultural land,” said Davey. “The marsh is now a haven for wildlife and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and an outstanding location for photographers, walkers and birdwatchers. The image shows a sunset across the flooded marsh at high tide ...”
The judges praised both the technical brilliance of the photo and the powerful story it was sharing, one which perfectly illustrates the role that nature recovery has to play in the climate crisis.
In second place was Tony Watson’s wide-angle picture (above) of water shortages at Haweswater in Lake District National Park, which he shared on Twitter with a powerful call to action to act now.
The Young Photographer of the Year award went to Fletcher Foot, 14, for an image of a stonechat bird on dried gorse in New Forest National Park. Colder temperatures are impacting them.
CNP chief executive Rose O’Neill said: “National Parks are critical to tackling the climate emergency. These photos illustrate what’s at stake if we don’t act, as well as giving hope in using nature as part of the solution.”
