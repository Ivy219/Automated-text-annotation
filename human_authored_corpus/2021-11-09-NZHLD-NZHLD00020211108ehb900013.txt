Greenhouse gas emissions battle not an equal one, writes Sonja Klinsky
Climate change has hit home around the world in 2021 with record heat waves, droughts, wildfires and extreme storms. Often, the people suffering most from the effects of climate change are those who have done the least to cause it.
To reduce climate change and protect those who are most vulnerable, it’s important to understand where emissions come from, who climate change is harming and how both of these patterns intersect with other forms of injustice.
I study the justice dilemmas presented by climate change and climate policies, and have been involved in international climate negotiations as an observer since 2009. Here are six topics to help explain the challenges.
Where emissions come fromOne common way to think about a country’s responsibility for climate change is to look at its greenhouse gas emissions per person.
For example, China is currently the single largest greenhouse gas emitter by country. But Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Australia and Canada all have more than twice China’s per capita emissions. And they each have more than 100 times the per capita emissions of several countries in Africa.
These differences are very important from a justice perspective.
The majority of emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels to power industries, stores, homes and schools and produce goods and services, including food, transport and infrastructure, to name just a few.
As a country’s emissions increase, they are less tied to essentials for human wellbeing. Measures of wellbeing rise fast with relatively small increases in emissions, but then level off. That means high-emitting countries could reduce their emissions significantly without reducing the wellbeing of their populations, while lower-income, lower-emitting countries cannot.
Low-income nations have argued for years that, in a context in which emissions must be dramatically reduced in the next half-century, it would be unjust to require them to cut essential investments in areas richer nations already have invested in, such as access to electricity, education and basic healthcare, while those in richer countries continue to enjoy lifestyles with high consumption of energy and goods.
Responsibility over decades Looking at current emissions alone misses another important aspect of climate injustice: Greenhouse gas emissions accumulate over time.
Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, and this accumulation drives climate change. CO2 traps heat, warming the planet. Some countries and regions bear vastly more responsibility for cumulative emissions than others.
For instance, the US has emitted over a quarter of all greenhouse gases since the 1750s, while the entire continent of Africa has emitted only about 3 per cent.
People today continue to benefit from wealth and infrastructure that was generated with energy linked to these emissions decades ago.
Differences within countriesThe benefits of fossil fuels have been uneven within countries, as well.
From this perspective, thinking about climate justice requires attention to patterns of wealth. A study by the Stockholm Environment Institute and Oxfam found that 5 per cent of the world’s population was responsible for 36 per cent of the greenhouse gases from 1990-2015.
The poorest half of the population was responsible for less than 6 per cent of emissions. These patterns are directly tied to the lack of access to energy by the poorest half of the world’s population and the high consumption of the wealthiest through things like luxury air travel, second homes and personal transport. They also show how actions by a few high emitters could reduce a region’s climate impact.
Similarly, over one-third of global carbon emissions from fossil fuels and cement over the past 50 years can be directly traced to 20 firms, primarily producers of oil and gas. This draws attention to the need to develop policies capable of holding large corporations accountable for their role in climate change.
Who is harmed by climate change?Understanding where emissions come from is only part of the climate justice dilemma. Poor countries and regions often also face greater risks from climate change.
Some small island countries, such as Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands, face threats to their very survival as sea levels rise. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the Arctic and mountain areas face much more rapid climate change than other parts of the world. In parts of Africa, changes in temperature and precipitation are contributing to food security concerns.
Many of these communities bear little responsibility for the cumulative emissions driving climate change. And they have the fewest resources to protect themselves.
Climate impacts — such as floods, storms or droughts — affect people differently depending on their wealth and on their involvement in decision making. Processes that marginalise people, such as racial injustice and colonialism, mean some people in a country or community are more likely than others to be able to protect themselves from climate harms.
Strategies for a just agreement These justice issues are central to talks at the United Nations’ Glasgow climate conference and beyond.
Many discussions will focus on who should reduce emissions and how poor countries’ reductions should be supported. Investing in renewable energy, for example, can avoid future emissions, but low-income countries need financial help.
Wealthy countries have been slow to meet their commitment to provide US$100 billion ($140.7b) a year to help developing countries adapt to the changing climate, and the costs of adaptation continue to rise.
Some of the most important issues from a justice perspective must be dealt with locally, within countries.
Systemic racism cannot be dealt with at the international level.
Creating local and national plans for protecting the most vulnerable people and holding corporations accountable will also need to happen within countries.
