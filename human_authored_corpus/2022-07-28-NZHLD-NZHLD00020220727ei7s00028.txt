●Over two thirds of people globally are concerned about the impacts of climate change, both in their own countries and around the world. New Zealanders are the most concerned about the impact of climate change seen globally compared to people in other countries around the world.
●There is an increased level of awareness of the urgency of the climate crisis. Compared to last year, significantly more New Zealanders recognise that individuals, businesses and government need to act now.
●However, this has not translated into clear changes in how people plan to act. The proportion of the public, both globally and in New Zealand, planning to make pro-environmental changes over the coming year has not increased significantly since last year.
●People’s understanding of what to do as individuals to reduce contribution to carbon emissions also remains low. Recycling and growing / producing your own food are incorrectly identified by New Zealanders as the top-2 most impactful carbon reducing actions, while living car-free or changing to a vegan diet (which have a far higher impact) are not seen by most as having a major impact.
●Interestingly, New Zealanders are great recyclers (with 95% indicating that they are already recycling or are likely to start recycling in the next 12 months) but are particularly reluctant to eat less meat (42% say they are unlikely to reduce their meat consumption) and dairy products (49% are unlikely to reduce dairy consumption).
●Despite progress over the last 12 months, awareness of governments’ climate change action plan remains fairly low. Globally, just 39% agree that their government has a clear plan in place for how government, businesses and people are going to work together to tackle climate change. New Zealanders have a better awareness, with 46% recognising that the government has a clear climate action plan.
