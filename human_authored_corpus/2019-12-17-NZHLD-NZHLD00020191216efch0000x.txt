Global efforts to tackle climate change have stalled due to a lack of ambition, the UN Secretary General said, as a major conference in Madrid drew to a close with a watered-down agreement.
The 197 parties to the UN talks agreed to the need for new emissions cuts but they stopped short of concrete commitments and left the outstanding issues of the Paris Agreement undecided.
“The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition,” said Antonio Guterres. “But we must not give up, and I will not give up.”
Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the 2015 Paris accord and chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, said: “The result is really a mixed bag, and a far cry from what science tells us is needed.”
Brazil, Australia and the US were singled out for their refusal to compromise on their emissions targets. The European Union had led a coalition of countries who were calling for greater commitments and resistance to compromises over carbon trading.
The snail’s pace of the talks was in marked contrast to the alarm and sense of urgency raised by activists and scientists.
In the days leading up to the agreement, reports noted that global emissions had risen since 2015, and current warming was on track to lead to a 3C increase in temperature. — Telegraph Media Group
