Just over $20 million will go towards projects in the Solomon Islands that will help tackle climate change, support local youth and improve facilities for the upcoming Pacific Games.
Deputy Prime Minister Carmel Sepuloni is leading a Pacific mission in the region this week; visiting the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Tonga in the first trip of its kind since Covid-19.
On the delegation’s first stop, in the Solomons, Sepuloni and Minister for Climate Change James Shaw announced $15m of climate finance would go into the existing Solomon Islands Provincial Capacity Development Fund.
The monetary boost is to help develop and improve local communities’ climate adaptation plans and projects.
Speaking in the country’s capital city of Honiara, Sepuloni described the threat of climate change as a “global challenge” that therefore required a global and collective action.
“That’s why we’re stepping up to provide climate finance to support provincial governments to build climate resilience at the grassroots.”
She said the heart of this week’s mission was the importance of supporting local and indigenous-led solutions to support effective climate action.
“We’ve listened to Pacific leaders and they’ve told us they want their people to live in their countries for as long as possible — and to retain their social and cultural identity.”
Shaw pointed out that Solomon Islanders live in rural and low-lying coastal areas, which are on the frontline of the climate crisis, but are those who have contributed the least to climate change.
As well as climate change funding, the Government also announced a total of $3 million to go towards helping to make the 2023 Pacific Games more accessible and inclusive for those people with disabilities.
The Solomon Islands will host this year’s tournament in November and is tipped to be a huge event for the region.
