Researchers studying the effects of climate change on severe weather events in New Zealand have found that the extreme rainfall that brought flooding to Canterbury in May was 10 to 15per cent more intense as a result of human influence on the climate system.
The findings come from the MBIE-funded research project Extreme Weather Event Real-time Attribution Machine (Eweram).
It seeks to provide scientific analysis and expert assessment to inform statements about the role of climate change in the severity and frequency of extreme weather.
The project includes expertise of researchers from five institutions namely, Bodeker Scientific, MetService, Niwa, Victoria University of Wellington, and the University of Canterbury. The flooding — from May 29 to 31 — was found to be a once-in-200 years event.
A spokesperson for Eweram said it was caused by a slow-moving low near central New Zealand that directed an easterly flow onto the South Island, with a subtropical feed of moisture delivering prolonged heavy rain.
The event prompted MetService to issue a red warning and a state of emergency was declared. The Insurance Council puts the insured losses from the event at $43.8 million.
The research team’s analysis, using MetService’s ensemble forecast system, indicates that compared to a climate system unaffected by human activities, around 10-15per cent more rain fell during the event.
