Science reporter Jamie Morton’s article “Marine heatwave in El Nino a surprise” should shake us all up to the urgency of the need for dramatic climate change mitigation measures.
If Ben Noll, our Niwa forecaster, is surprised at the 1C to 2C above average sea temperatures, then may I suggest we should be alarmed.
Later in the article Dr Eric Behrens states New Zealand waters are warming at twice to three times the global rate, and that to accurately define ecological impacts, more research is needed.
We also need research into how we get our political leaders to take effective climate change mitigation measures.
