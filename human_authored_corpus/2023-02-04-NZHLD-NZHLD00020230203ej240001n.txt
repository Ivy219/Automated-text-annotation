Letter of the week K. Rix-Trott, Raglan
Recent weather events reinforce the fact that the biggest threat facing the economy and indeed life on our planet is climate change yet we seem to be ignoring it or putting off doing anything.
To those who say that New Zealand contributes only a very small amount to global emissions, I say that per capita we are among the highest emitters.
Around the world each individual, family, business and organisation needs to make changes to bring down our emissions â€” governments cannot do it without our co-operation and contribution. Also, the wealthier among us contribute the most to emissions and need to make the greatest changes. With elections coming up this year, we would do well to consider seriously who will best address this urgent issue here in New Zealand.
We no longer have time on our side.
