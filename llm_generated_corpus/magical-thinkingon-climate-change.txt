In the wake of the devastating floods that swept through parts of the North Island last month, a growing number of Kiwis are turning to alternative solutions to combat the increasingly frequent and ferocious weather events, fuelled by climate change. Dubbed as "magical thinking," this trend sees individuals relying on ancient practices, mystical beliefs, and unproven remedies to mitigate the effects of global warming.

Experts warn that this approach may be well-intentioned but misguided, as it diverts attention and resources away from evidence-based measures to combat climate change. Instead, proponents of magical thinking argue that holistic approaches can help create a sense of community and foster resilience in the face of adversity.

Frances, a resident of Whanganui, is just one example of someone who has incorporated magical thinking into her daily life. She claims that performing daily rituals, such as lighting incense and saying prayers, has helped her feel more connected to nature and more empowered to handle the challenges posed by climate change.

"I know it might sound strange to some people, but for me, it's about acknowledging that there's more to life than just science and technology," Frances explained. "I believe that our thoughts and intentions have the power to shape the world around us. By focusing on positive energy and intentions, I feel like I'm doing my part to create a better future."

While there is no conclusive evidence to support the efficacy of magical thinking as a viable solution to climate change, its proponents argue that it can have a profound impact on an individual's mental well-being and sense of purpose. Research suggests that engaging in mindfulness practices, such as meditation and yoga, can reduce stress and anxiety levels, and promote a sense of connection to nature.

Dr. Emily Chen, a climate economist at the University of Auckland, acknowledged the potential benefits of magical thinking, but warned that it should not be relied upon as a primary solution to combat climate change. "While it's understandable that people may want to find alternative ways to cope with the effects of climate change, we need to be grounded in evidence-based solutions that address the root causes of this crisis," Dr. Chen emphasized.

Despite the reservations of experts, the trend towards magical thinking shows no signs of slowing down. Social media platforms are filled with posts and stories from individuals sharing their own experiences with holistic practices, and the rise of online courses and workshops offering guidance on how to harness the power of intention and energy is undeniable.

For his part, Kai, a Wellington-based artist, believes that magical thinking can be a powerful tool in the fight against climate change. He has begun incorporating ancient mystical practices into his daily routine, and claims that it has given him a newfound sense of purpose and connection to the natural world.

"I used to feel like I was just a small part of a much larger problem," Kai reflected. "But by incorporating magical thinking into my life, I feel like I'm doing something tangible to make a difference. It's not just about planting trees or reducing my carbon footprint â€“ it's about harnessing the power of my thoughts and intentions to create real change."

As the world grapples with the devastating impacts of climate change, it is clear that Kiwis are looking for innovative and alternative solutions to traditional approaches. While the jury is still out on the efficacy of magical thinking, it is undeniable that this trend has captured the imagination of many, and could potentially contribute to a broader cultural shift towards greater awareness and action on climate change.

In the words of Auckland-based environmental activist, Taha, "Climate change is a global problem that requires a global response. While we need to rely on evidence-based solutions to tackle this crisis, we also need to tap into the power of imagination and creativity to find innovative solutions. Magical thinking might not be the panacea, but it can be a valuable tool in our collective effort to create a more sustainable future."
