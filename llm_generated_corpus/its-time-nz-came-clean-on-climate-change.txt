As the world struggles to navigate the complexities of climate change, New Zealand finds itself at a critical crossroads. While our country has long been touted as a beacon of environmental leadership, the reality is that we are still lagging behind our international counterparts in tackling this pressing issue.

Despite the recognition of climate change as a priority area by the current government, the progress made so far has been slow and piecemeal. The lack of urgency and inadequate policy response has led to growing concerns among the public and experts alike. It's time for New Zealand to take a hard look at its climate record and identify the necessary steps to truly address this global crisis.

In recent years, our country has been hit with an increasing number of extreme weather events, from devastating droughts to torrential rainfall, bushfires, and earthquakes. These events are not only a testament to the unpredictable forces of nature but also a reflection of the Anthropocene epoch, in which human activities are causing unprecedented changes to our environment.

Climate change is no longer just a distant threat; it's a reality that's already affecting our daily lives. Warmer temperatures, sea level rise, and altered precipitation patterns are having far-reaching impacts on our economic, social, and cultural fabric. The consequences are stark: more frequent and severe weather events, declining biodiversity, and increased exposure to natural disasters, to name a few.

So, what's holding us back? The answer lies in inadequate policy, an unsustainable political agenda, and a lack of commitment to meaningful action. Our government has been slow to respond to the growing threat of climate change, often prioritizing short-term economic gains over long-term environmental sustainability.

The UK, for instance, has made significant strides in reducing its carbon footprint, with a 2019 report showing a 5% reduction in emissions between 2017 and 2018. Germany has also made significant progress, with a 2019 report highlighting a 23% reduction in emissions since 1990. Meanwhile, New Zealand's emissions have continued to rise, with a 2020 report from Stats NZ showing a 1.8% increase in greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2017.

The truth is that we have options. We can follow the lead of countries like Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands, which have made significant strides in transitioning to a low-carbon economy. We can adopt policies that prioritize renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, and promote sustainable land use practices. We can also increase our investment in research and development, supporting the development of new technologies that will help us navigate this complex issue.

A critical component of New Zealand's climate strategy is the need for a comprehensive, nationally coordinated approach. The current government's efforts, however limited, are fragmented and often piecemeal. We need a coherent vision that encompasses all levels of government, industry, and civil society. This includes the establishment of a dedicated cabinet committee, strengthened engagement with iwi and Pasifika communities, and a robust program of public education and awareness.

Another crucial aspect of New Zealand's climate response is the need for policy to be guided by science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a clear and unequivocal warning: we have approximately a decade to take drastic action to limit global warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels. We can no longer afford the luxury of debating the science; it's time to accept the reality of climate change and develop policies that are based on the best available evidence.

The public is hungry for leadership on this issue, and it's time for our government to take bold action. We need a comprehensive and inclusive approach that brings together the best of our country's thinking and expertise. It's not just about making a punitive adjustment to our lifestyle; it's about creating a sustainable future that respects the rights of future generations.

Call me optimistic, but I believe that New Zealand has the capacity to be a leader in this area. We have the potential to pioneer innovative solutions, to drive international cooperation, and to demonstrate that a strong economy and a clean environment are not mutually exclusive. It's time for our government to show the courage of its convictions, to make the necessary political decisions, and to put the interests of our planet ahead of partisan interests.

Make no mistake; the stakes are high. Climate change is a global challenge that requires a collective effort from governments, businesses, and individuals alike. We must come together to address this issue, to reduce our carbon footprint, and to build a more resilient future for ourselves and future generations. It's time for New Zealand to join the ranks of the global leaders and champions of climate action. We have the knowledge, we have the resources, and we have the moral obligation to take steps towards a cleaner, greener future.
