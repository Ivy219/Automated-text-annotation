In a move that has sent shockwaves around the world, negotiators at the United Nations' latest climate change summit have reached a compromised agreement that falls short of expectations on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The newly minted pact, signed off by nearly 200 countries, commits nations to "pursue efforts" to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a goal set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, it lacked the crucial detail of a shared timeline for achieving this target, sparking outrage among climate activists and scientists who consider it a missed opportunity.

"It's a lost opportunity to really get serious about climate change," said Professor James Renwick, a renowned climate scientist at Victoria University of Wellington. "The fact that countries have failed to agree on a more robust plan to reduce emissions is concerning, given the urgency of the crisis we're facing."

The UN conference, which concluded in Madrid, Spain, was attended by world leaders and climate negotiators who worked tirelessly to finalize the agreement. However, in the end, the pact lacked concrete targets for reducing emissions, with the exception of a vague commitment to peak emissions by the mid-2020s.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who has been a vocal advocate for climate action, was among the leaders who expressed disappointment with the outcome. "While the new agreement sends a strong message on the urgent need to act on climate change, I'm disappointed that we weren't able to agree on more ambitious targets for emissions reduction," she said.

Climate advocates, too, were vocal in their criticism, accusing world leaders of playing politics over the future of the planet. "The science is clear – to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, we need to reduce emissions by 45% by 2030. This deal falls far short of what's needed," said Rachel Smolkin, campaigner at environmental group 350.org.

Despite the backlash, some nations, including small island states and developing countries, saw the agreement as a step in the right direction. "We've made significant progress," said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. "The new pact recognizes the importance of equity, justice, and the need for increased climate finance."

The agreement did address some key issues, including the creation of a new "adaptation" fund, designed to support developing countries in coping with the impacts of climate change. It also solidified the Paris Agreement's objective of limiting global warming to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius, while aiming to hold the increase to 1.5 degrees.

However, the lack of ambition on emissions reduction has raised concerns about the treaty's effectiveness in addressing the root cause of the climate crisis. "We've seen what happens when the goalposts are moved," said Dr. Renwick. "Rhetoric and ambition need to translate into action – we need countries to deliver on their commitments, and we need more ambition on emissions reduction."

In the wake of the conference, climate scientists are warning of increasingly dire consequences if global temperatures exceed the 1.5-degree target. Rising sea levels, more intense natural disasters, and devastating droughts are just a few of the projected consequences of inaction.

New Zealand is under pressure to increase its ambition on climate action, particularly in light of recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warning of the devastating impacts of climate change. Last year, the country set a goal to reduce its emissions to net zero by 2050, but climate experts argue that this target needs to be accelerated to align with the more ambitious Paris Agreement.

For some, the UN conference was a poignant reminder of the world's failure to unite against the climate crisis. "The divide between the have and have-nots was starkly evident in Madrid – the rich got richer, and the poor got poorer," said Sunita Rao, climate campaigner with Greenpeace.

In the face of overwhelming evidence and warnings, the world is left to ponder what needs to be done to address the climate crisis. As leaders return to their countries, the clock is ticking on fulfilling the promise of the Paris Agreement – will they seize the opportunity, or succumb to the temptation of inaction?

In the meantime, climate advocates continue to push for bolder action, urging world leaders to come back to the negotiating table with renewed commitment to reducing emissions and limiting the global temperature rise. As the climate crisis deepens, the stakes could not be higher – the future of the planet hangs in the balance, and it is up to the world's leaders to choose the path forward.
