Wellington, New Zealand - A group of prominent investors, asset managers, and financial experts gathered at the NASDAQ Conference in Auckland yesterday, calling for immediate action on climate change to mitigate its devastating impacts on the global economy. The gathering, attended by over 200 delegates from around the world, emphasized the urgent need for the finance sector to play a more significant role in addressing the climate crisis.

The conference was hosted by the NZ Climate Change Coalition, a non-profit organization that brings together environmentalists, business leaders, and policymakers to promote sustainable economic development and climate action. The event featured keynote speeches, panel discussions, and expert presentations, all focused on the critical role that finance can play in addressing the climate emergency.

One of the primary concerns raised by the investors and financial experts was the potential financial risks and implications of climate change. "Climate change is a systemic risk that has the potential to destabilize global financial markets and economies," said Dr. Claire Perry O'Neill, a member of the UK Parliament and former Climate Change Minister. "It's essential that the finance sector takes proactive steps to mitigate these risks and ensures that investment decisions are made with a consideration of the long-term impacts of climate change."

According to a report released by the UN Environment Programme, the global economy could lose up to USD 32 trillion by 2100 if global warming exceeds 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels. This staggering figure highlights the need for immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy.

The investors and financial experts at the conference emphasized the importance of integrating climate risk analysis into investment decisions and portfolio management. "Our role as investors is to ensure that we are not only generating returns but also promoting sustainable development and reducing the environmental impact of our investments," said Justin Ong, Head of Sustainability at the NZ Superannuation Fund. "By integrating climate risk analysis into our investment decisions, we can mitigate potential losses and promote ecosystem services that are critical for long-term economic growth and development."

Another significant area of focus was the role of green bonds in financing climate-resilient infrastructure and sustainable projects. "Green bonds have the potential to revolutionize the way we finance sustainable infrastructure and development," said Jay Rosenthal, CEO of the Green Bond Initiative. "By providing a dedicated channel for investment in green projects, we can unlock the capital necessary to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

The conference also highlighted the crucial role that policymakers can play in addressing climate change. "Policymakers must send a clear signal that climate change is a top priority and provide the necessary support and incentives for the finance sector to transition to a low-carbon economy," said Deborah Martin, CEO of the NZ Institute of Directors. "This includes implementing policies that promote sustainable development, reduce carbon emissions, and support the transition to renewable energy sources."

The event concluded with a call to action for the finance sector to take immediate and decisive action on climate change. "We urge investors, asset managers, and financial institutions to recognize the critical role they can play in addressing the climate crisis and to take proactive steps to integrate climate risk analysis into their investment decisions," said Dr. Perry O'Neill. "Together, we can drive the transition to a low-carbon economy and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come."

In response to the growing demands for action on climate change, the NZ Government has announced plans to introduce a new climate-risk reporting framework for listed companies. The framework, which is expected to be implemented by 2023, will require companies to disclose their exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as their long-term strategies for addressing these risks.

The recognition of climate risk by the NZ Government is a significant step forward in addressing the climate crisis, according to Dr. James Renwick, a climate scientist at Victoria University of Wellington. "The introduction of a climate-risk reporting framework is a critical step towards ensuring that NZ companies are prepared for the impacts of climate change and are taking proactive steps to reduce their own carbon footprint," said Dr. Renwick.

As the global economy continues to grapple with the challenges posed by climate change, the investors, asset managers, and financial experts who attended the NASDAQ Conference in Auckland yesterday underscored the urgent need for immediate and decisive action. By integrating climate risk analysis into investment decisions, promoting sustainable infrastructure and development, and supporting policymakers in their efforts to address climate change, the finance sector can play a critical role in mitigating the impacts of climate change and driving the transition to a low-carbon economy.
