The recent bout of severe weather events in New Zealand, from the unprecedented floods in the west to the scorching heatwaves in the east, has left many asking the same question: has bad weather changed our view of climate change?

For years, climate change has been a topic of heated debate, with some dismissing its severity and others plotting the catastrophic consequences. But as the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events continue to rise, it seems the nation is slowly but surely shifting its thinking.

Take the floods in Geraldton and Hokitika, for instance. When the rain finally relented and the waters receded, residents were left to survey the damage: homes destroyed, businesses ruined, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages. It's little wonder that the once-reluctant public is now more receptive to the idea that climate change is real and that we're not just witnesses to its effects, but also contributors.

"It's like the floodwaters finally washed away the ' unsure' label on climate change," says Dr. Emma Smith, a climate scientist at Victoria University. "The brazen sight of the devastation has put climate change front and center in our collective consciousness. People are starting to grasp the magnitude of the issue, and it's both unsettling and empowering."

Empowering, in this case, means accepting the science and taking action. A recent survey by the Morgan Foundation revealed that 65% of Kiwis now consider climate change a major issue, up from 47% just five years ago. Moreover, the number of Kiwis who believe human activity is causing climate change has jumped to 57%, up from 44%.

This shift in public opinion is not lost on policymakers either. "Climate change is now firmly on our radar," says Climate Change Minister James Shaw. "We're working tirelessly to reduce our emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. We're optimistic that our efforts will pay off, but we know we need to do more, and we're working closely with local communities to ensure we're taking the right steps."

Of course, there are still those who question the science or dismiss the urgency. Some argue that climate change is a natural phenomenon, that it's being exaggerated or that the solutions are too costly. However, as the scientific consensus grows stronger and the evidence becomes more apparent, even these skeptics are starting to waver.

For instance, the National Iwi Federation, which represents 47 iwi across the country, has recently come out strongly in support of climate action. "We're not just talking about our canoes being lost to the rising seas; we're talking about our people being displaced, our culture being eroded, and our very way of life being threatened," says Te Paora Flavell, the federation's chair. "We can no longer just observe the damage; we need to take action and demand that our government does too."

As the nation grapples with the new reality of climate change, there are some experts who warn that it's not just about the science; it's also about the psychology. "We need to acknowledge the emotional toll of climate change," says stress expert Dr. Jane Wilson. "The anxiety, the feeling of helplessness – these are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. We need to create safe spaces for people to process their emotions and find ways to cope."

In the face of such overwhelming evidence, what can individual Kiwis do to make a difference? Not everyone can embark on a grand adventure to save the planet, but small actions can add up to make a significant impact.

For instance, changing your daily habits – like turning off lights, using public transport, or reducing food waste – can make a difference. So too can supporting businesses that prioritize sustainability and advocating for climate action. "Every voice matters," says climate activist and motivational speaker, Cameron Sorenson. "We don't need to be experts to make a difference. We just need to show up, listen, and be willing to learn and adapt."

As the nation rebuilds and moves forward from the devastating floods and heatwaves, it's evident that bad weather has indeed changed our view of climate change. The question is no longer if it's real or if it's a hoax – it's how we're going to combat its effects and build a more resilient, sustainable future.

Perhaps, as the ancient Maori proverb goes, "Kia kaha ki te whenua" – "Be strong to the land." We've been given a second chance to get it right. Now, it's time to act.
