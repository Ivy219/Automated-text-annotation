A contentious storm is brewing in the world of climate change policy, as stakeholders and experts begin to scrutinize the long-awaited proposals from the Climate Change Commission (CCC) on the future of New Zealand's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).

The CCC's report, released earlier this month, outlines the commission's recommendations for the ETS, including increasing the carbon price to $55 per tonne by 2025, introducing a new carbon budget for the electricity sector, and extending the scheme to cover more industries and activities.

While the report was hailed by many as a bold and necessary step towards reducing New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions, others are crying foul, accusing the commission of making proposals that will disproportionately affect certain sectors and industries without providing adequate support or alternatives.

At the heart of the controversy is the proposed carbon price increase, which has been criticized by some as too rapid and too high. The CCC's report suggests that a higher carbon price will help drive investment in cleaner technologies and reduce emissions, but opponents argue that it will disproportionately affect certain industries, such as agriculture and manufacturing, and lead to job losses and increased costs for consumers.

"Raising the carbon price to $55 per tonne by 2025 is a significant increase, and it's going to put a lot of pressure on certain industries that are already struggling to adapt to a changing climate," said Dr. Karl Smallhurst, a senior researcher at the Victoria University of Wellington's School of Government.

"Without proper support or alternatives, some industries will be forced to make significant changes overnight, which could lead to job losses and economic disruption. We need to be careful to ensure that the transition to a low-carbon economy is managed in a way that is fair and equitable for all."

Other stakeholders are expressing concerns about the report's proposal to introduce a new carbon budget for the electricity sector, which they say could have unintended consequences for the industry. The CCC's report suggests that the electricity sector should aim to reduce its emissions to net-zero by 2050, which could be achieved through a combination of renewable energy generation, energy storage, and carbon capture and storage.

While many advocate for a rapid transition to renewable energy, others are concerned that the report's proposal could lead to a "dash for gas" – where the electricity sector relies heavily on natural gas as a bridging fuel, rather than investing in more sustainable solutions.

"The report's proposal for a net-zero carbon budget for the electricity sector is a great goal, but it needs to be implemented in a way that is pragmatic and realistic," said Bruce Robertson, the CEO of Mercury Energy, one of New Zealand's largest energy companies.

"We can't just replace all existing coal-fired generation with renewable energy overnight. We need to have a more nuanced approach that takes into account the different technologies and fuels that are available, and that provides support for the industry to make the transition in a way that is fair and sustainable for all."

Despite the concerns and criticisms, many argue that the CCC's report provides a long-awaited and much-needed boost to New Zealand's efforts to address climate change. The report's proposals are seen as a key step towards achieving the country's goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 50% below 2005 levels by 2030.

"The report is a crucial step towards addressing the climate crisis, and its proposals provide a clear roadmap for action," said Stuff reports that the Minister of Climate Change, James Shaw, has welcomed the report and its recommendations, saying that they will help to drive investment in clean energy and reduce emissions.

"We need to take bold action to address the climate crisis, and the CCC's report provides a blue-print for how we can do that. We're committed to working with stakeholders to implement the report's recommendations and achieve our climate change goals."

As the government and stakeholders begin the process of reviewing and responding to the CCC's report, one thing is clear: the debate around New Zealand's future ETS will be long and contentious. While some see the report as a vital step towards addressing the climate crisis, others are expressing concerns about the impact of the proposed changes on certain industries and the economy as a whole.

Ultimately, the report's success will depend on the government's ability to balance the needs of different stakeholders and industries with the imperative of addressing the climate crisis. As one expert noted, "The challenge will be to craft a solution that is fair, effective, and sustainable – and that takes into account the diverse needs and perspectives of different stakeholders."
