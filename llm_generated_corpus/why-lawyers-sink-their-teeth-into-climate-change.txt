A growing number of lawyers in New Zealand are turning their attention to the pressing issue of climate change, recognizing the need for urgent action to mitigate its effects and seeking innovative ways to hold those responsible accountable. With the climate crisis escalating, lawyers are indeed sinking their teeth into the problem, pushing beyond the traditional realm of environmental law to tackle the complex challenges posed by this multifaceted threat.

Recent events have galvanized the legal community's response. The catastrophic floods in parts of New Zealand's North Island in the wake of Cyclone Gabrielle, which left thousands of people displaced and the country's infrastructure ravaged, has underscored the imperative for robust action. Similarly, the lingering impact of the drought in the Hawke's Bay region has highlighted the need for effective climate-resilient planning and policy development.

Climate change poses a unique set of challenges for lawyers, who must navigate rapidly evolving scientific research, policy frameworks, and rapidly changing environmental conditions. The issue is so complex that even lawyers with years of experience in environmental law may require specific training or upskilling to effectively address the legal aspects of climate change.

The legal profession is no stranger to the climate debate. Authorities have long been addressing the issue through policy development, regulations, and litigation. However, the scale and scope of the crisis demands a more comprehensive response. In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of environmental lawyers focusing on climate change, and this trend is likely to continue.

One area where lawyers are making a significant impact is in public interest litigation. Cases have been filed in courts across the country, challenging the government's climate policies and practices. For instance, the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of R v Attorney-General (Environment: Climate Change) 2020 NZCA 588, where the court ruled that the government had a duty to take steps to mitigate the effects of climate change, has set a significant precedent.

The case was brought by the Productivity Commission, which argued that the government's policies were not adequate to meet the country's climate goals. The commission contended that the government had a legal duty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and recommended that it adopt policies to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

Lawyers are also playing a crucial role in advising companies and organizations on climate-related risks and opportunities. Climate-related risks are increasingly impacting business operations, supply chains, and shareholder value. As a result, companies are seeking legal advice on how to manage these risks and position themselves for a low-carbon future.

In addition to their work on public interest litigation and corporate climate risk management, lawyers are also contributing to the development of climate-resilient policy and planning frameworks. The government's Climate Change Response Act 2002, which sets out the country's climate change goals and strategies, provides a framework for lawyers to work within. However, the law is expected to be repealed and replaced with a new Act in the coming years, offering an opportunity for lawyers to influence the development of a more comprehensive climate policy.

Lawyers are also working with indigenous communities, who are often disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. The Te Urewera Deed of Settlement, signed in 2015, recognized the Treaty of Waitangi principles as relevant to climate change decision-making. This has led to a growing recognition of the need for Maori-led initiatives and solutions.

The Maori saying "kaitiakitanga" – guardianship – is becoming increasingly relevant in the context of climate change. Kaitiakitanga emphasizes the importance of Maori people taking an active role in protecting the environment and future generations. Lawyers are working closely with Maori communities to develop climate-resilient decision-making processes that acknowledge their unique cultural perspectives and values.

New Zealand's response to climate change is not limited to domestic efforts. The country is also actively engaging with international efforts to address the global crisis. The Paris Agreement, ratified by New Zealand in 2016, aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Lawyers are working with government agencies, NGOs, and international organizations to ensure that New Zealand's climate commitments align with its expected impacts on the global climate.

The role of lawyers in responding to climate change is multifaceted and far-reaching. From public interest litigation to advising companies on climate risks, to developing climate-resilient policy and planning frameworks, to working with indigenous communities to develop solutions that address the unique impacts of climate change, lawyers are undoubtedly sinking their teeth into the problem. As the climate crisis continues to escalate, the legal profession will play an increasingly critical role in driving change and ensuring that New Zealand is well-equipped to face the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
