The quest to mitigate the effects of climate change has been a longstanding and complex issue for governments and international organizations around the world. In New Zealand, the journey to address this pressing global problem has been marked by twists and turns, with politicians, experts, and the public alike grappling with the challenges and uncertainties involved.

The road to climate action began to take shape in the early 2000s, when the then-Labour government passed the Climate Change Response Act. This legislation established the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), a key mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by placing a price on carbon. The ETS was designed to provide a financial incentive for companies and individuals to reduce their emissions, with the aim of achieving a 50% reduction in net emissions by 2050.

However, the introduction of the ETS was not without controversy. Critics argued that it would unfairly burden certain industries, such as agriculture and forestry, which were not covered by the scheme. Others felt that the emissions reduction targets were too modest and would not make a significant impact on the global problem.

Fast forward to the 2010s, and the National Party, which had taken power in 2008, began to make changes to the ETS. The government introduced a cap on the number of free carbon credits allocated to industries, and also limited the number of credits that could be carried over from previous years. These changes were intended to reduce the cost of compliance and make the scheme more business-friendly.

But the changes also sparked concerns about the effectiveness of the ETS. Environmental groups argued that the weakened scheme would undermine efforts to reduce emissions and achieve the country's climate change goals. The debate surrounding the ETS became increasingly politicized, with some politicians questioning the science of climate change and others arguing that the scheme was too costly for businesses.

The 2017 general election saw a significant shift in the country's climate change policy landscape. The Labour Party, in coalition with the Green Party, came to power with a promise to take a more ambitious approach to reducing emissions. The government established a Climate Change Commission, tasked with providing independent advice on emissions reduction targets and policies.

The commission's first report, released in 2020, recommended a range of measures to reduce emissions, including increasing the price of carbon credits, implementing a low-carbon transport policy, and promoting sustainable land use practices. The report also emphasized the need for a long-term approach, with a focus on achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

The government has since made significant progress in implementing the commission's recommendations. In 2020, it passed the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act, which set a target of reducing net emissions to zero by 2050. The act also established a framework for the ETS, including a plan to increase the price of carbon credits to $50 per ton by 2025.

However, the journey to a low-carbon economy is far from over. The government is still grappling with the challenges of reducing emissions from hard-to-abate sectors, such as agriculture and industry. There are also concerns about the impact of climate change policy on the economy, particularly for small businesses and low-income households.

Despite these challenges, there are signs of progress. The government's Emissions Reduction Plan, released in 2022, outlines a range of measures to reduce emissions across key sectors. The plan includes initiatives such as increasing the use of electric vehicles, promoting energy-efficient buildings, and supporting the transition to renewable energy.

There are also encouraging signs of change at the community level. From the proliferation of community gardens and composting programs to the growth of sustainable agriculture and forestry practices, there is a growing movement towards a more environmentally conscious and sustainable way of living.

As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of climate change, New Zealand's experience serves as a reminder of the importance of perseverance and collaboration. From the twists and turns of policy development to the grassroots efforts of individuals and communities, the journey to a low-carbon future will require a sustained and collective effort.

Ultimately, the success of New Zealand's climate change policy will depend on its ability to balance the needs of different stakeholders and sectors, while also staying true to its commitment to reducing emissions and achieving a sustainable future. As the country looks to the future, it is clear that the road ahead will be long and complex, but with determination and a shared sense of purpose, the possibilities for positive change are endless.
