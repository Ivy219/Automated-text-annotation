Since taking office in January this year, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has faced a daunting task â€“ spearheading the country's efforts to tackle climate change. As the first National Party leader to hold the top job in over two decades, Luxon has inherited a climate agenda set in motion by his predecessor, Jacinda Ardern. With the country's net-zero emissions target looming large, the stakes are high for Luxon to demonstrate his commitment to the cause.

Early signs are promising. During his leadership campaign, Luxon signaled his intention to take climate change seriously, pledging to modernize the country's energy sector and increase investment in clean renewable energy. In his first major speech as Prime Minister, he reiterated this commitment, stating "We need to do everything we can to reduce our emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy."

A key metric to gauge Luxon's performance on climate change will be his government's handling of the delayed Zero Carbon Bill, a cornerstone of the previous government's climate strategy. The bill aimed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, a goal endorsed by the 2019 general election. Luxon's government must now pick up the baton and see it through to implementation.

One area where Luxon has made progress is in his communications around climate change. Gone are the skeptical whispers from the previous National administration; instead, he has taken a more collaborative approach, engaging with green scarecrow organizations and acknowledging the urgency of the crisis. His willingness to learn from experts and indigenous knowledge has been particularly refreshing, as he recognizes that climate change is a collective responsibility that requires diverse perspectives.

However, Luxon's words must be matched with tangible actions. The current objective is to reduce New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. Achieving this will require significant changes to the country's energy mix, transportation infrastructure, and agricultural practices.

To date, the government has taken some promising steps. A recent announcement on the establishment of a new Climate Change Agency has been welcomed, providing a centralized coordination hub for climate policymaking. Additionally, the government has signaled its intention to increase the use of renewable energy, setting a target of 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035.

Regarding transportation, Luxon has indicated a willingness to re-examine the role of fossil fuels in the country's transport sector. While no concrete policies have been announced thus far, rumors swirl about potential reforms to the tax regime and incentives for electric vehicles.

Agriculture, however, remains a sticking point. The sector is a significant contributor to New Zealand's emissions, with livestock an oversized component. While the government has promised to support farmers through the transition to lower-emission practices, critics argue that more needs to be done to incentivize behavioral change.

One area where Luxon's government has faced criticism is on the issue of oil and gas exploration. Recent announcements reopening discussion on drilling permits in the Gulf of Mexico have been met with unease from environmental groups and some within his own party. While energy security and economic viability will always be key considerations, Luxon must balance these concerns with the imperative to reduce emissions and protect the country's natural resources.

As Prime Minister, Luxon has also faced internal debates within his party on the climate agenda. Some National MPs have expressed concerns that the party's traditional base is skeptical of scientific consensus on climate change, leading to tension between fiscal responsibility and environmental stewardship. Luxon's leadership will be tested in navigating these internal divisions while maintaining a cohesive national narrative.

With the impending general election in 2023, the scrutiny on Luxon's climate credentials will only intensify. His responses to the current climate emergency will be shaped by a range of factors, including his own values, the party's ideological leanings, and the country's complex economic and social context.

To succeed, Luxon must prioritize bipartisanship, engaging with opposition parties and expert organizations to forge a collective commitment to a low-carbon future. He must also demonstrate leadership by example, encouraging a culture of climate resilience and sustainable development across government agencies, industries, and communities.

Ultimately, the test for Luxon will be whether he can turns words into actions, translating climate ambition into tangible policy reforms and tangible emissions reductions. With the clock ticking and global expectations high, New Zealand's Prime Minister must rise to the challenge, fostering a climate-resilient nation for future generations. As he embarks on this journey, the world will be watching, and the nation will be looking to him for direction and inspiration.
