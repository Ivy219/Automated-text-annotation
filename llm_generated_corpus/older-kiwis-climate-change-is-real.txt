A recent survey conducted by the New Zealand Council on the Ageing found a striking trend among older Kiwis – a strong awareness and acceptance of climate change. The research, which gathered data from over 1000 participants aged 65 and above, revealed that an astonishing 85% of respondents believed climate change is real and a pressing concern for the country.

This level of awareness and concern is a significant departure from the sometimes contentious debates surrounding climate change in recent years. According to Dr. Helen Schultz, a leading expert in gerontology and one of the researchers behind the study, this shift in attitude could be attributed to a range of factors.

"One reason might be that older Kiwis have lived through a significant amount of environmental degradation and pollution, making it easier for them to recognize the tangible effects of climate change on their daily lives," Dr. Schultz explained. "Additionally, many older people have children and grandchildren, which may give them an increased sense of responsibility to take action and protect the environment for future generations."

While the survey did not specifically ask about specific climate policies or actions, it appears that older Kiwis are not only aware of the issue but are also willing to take action. In fact, a significant 62% of respondents reported making changes to their daily routines to reduce their carbon footprint, such as reducing energy consumption, recycling more, and using public transport or walking/biking instead of driving.

The statistics reveal that older Kiwis are taking steps to contribute to a more sustainable future, even when faced with the challenges of aging. This trend is particularly noteworthy given the often-held assumption that older people are less concerned with issues like climate change.

"Older people are not immune to the impacts of climate change, and many are taking action to mitigate its effects," said Dr. Schultz. "In fact, older Kiwis are often well-equipped to take the initiative, having the baseline knowledge, skills, and experience to make meaningful changes to their daily routines."

In addition to the quantitative findings, the study also gathered qualitative data through focus groups and individual interviews with participants. These insights provided valuable insight into the attitudes and behaviors of older Kiwis when it comes to climate change.

One participant, a 72-year-old retired nurse from Auckland, summarized the sentiment of many: "I've lived through some of the worst environmental disasters of the past few decades, and it's only getting worse. I want to do my part to help reduce the impact – every little bit counts, and I'm willing to make some changes to my daily routine."

While the survey did not identify any specific 'generational' divide in terms of climate awareness, it did highlight the potential for older Kiwis to play a more prominent role in shaping the country's response to climate change. According to Dr. Schultz, this could involve mentoring and inspiring younger generations to take action, as well as advocating for policies and practices that prioritize environmental sustainability.

In the wake of the survey's findings, several stakeholders within the New Zealand government and environmental organizations are already taking notice. The Minister for the Climate Change Response, James Shaw, has expressed interest in engaging with older Kiwis on the issue, recognizing the importance of diverse perspectives and the potential leadership role they could play.

As the nation continues to grapple with the pressing issue of climate change, it is clear that older Kiwis are not disconnected from this critical debate. Rather, they have a significant say and a strong desire to contribute to a more sustainable future. As Dr. Schultz concluded, "Older Kiwis are not only aware of the issue, but they are also willing to take action and make a difference – now it's up to us to listen and learn from their experiences."

In the end, this survey sheds new light on the engagement and commitment of older Kiwis on the issue of climate change, demonstrating that individuals from all walks of life are taking steps to address this pressing issue.
