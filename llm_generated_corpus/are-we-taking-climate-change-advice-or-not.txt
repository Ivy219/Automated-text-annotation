As the world grapples with the existential threat of climate change, it's a question that has been increasingly on everyone's minds: are we actually listening to the science and taking action to mitigate its worst impacts? Or are we just paying lip service to the issue, while leaving the lion's share of the problem to be tackled by future generations?

The answer, unfortunately, is a resounding "it's unclear". While governments and corporations around the world have made grand declarations about their commitment to addressing climate change, the reality is that many of these promises remain unfilled.

In New Zealand, the story is mixed. On one hand, the Government has made some promising moves, such as setting a target of net-zero emissions by 2050, investing in renewable energy technologies, and implementing policies aimed at reducing waste and increasing sustainable land use practices.

On the other hand, the country's progress in this area is often inconsistent and lacking in meaningful action. For instance, despite the Government's boasts about its carbon-reducing ambition, New Zealand's carbon output has actually continued to rise in recent years, driven in part by the country's continued reliance on fossil fuels.

Furthermore, some of the key policies aimed at addressing climate change, such as the Zero Carbon Act, have been watered down or delayed, allowing the pace of progress to stall.

The lack of clear direction and decisive action on climate change is not unique to New Zealand, of course. Around the world, governments are struggling to balance the competing demands of economic growth, social justice, and environmental protection.

In the United States, for example, the Trump administration has taken a scorched-earth approach to climate change, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and obstructing efforts to regulate emissions.

Meanwhile, in Europe, the EU has made some significant strides in reducing its carbon footprint, but even here, there are concerns that the pace of progress is too slow and that member states are not doing enough to meet their commitments.

So what's going on? Why are governments struggling to keep up with the pace of climate change, despite decades of warnings from scientists and increasing public awareness of the issue?

One major obstacle is the enduring influence of fossil fuel interests on politics. The energy industry has long been a powerful force in shaping government policy, and it shows no signs of relinquishing its grip anytime soon.

In New Zealand, for instance, the oil and gas industry has been vocal in its opposition to proposed offshore drilling regulations, while in the United States, the fossil fuel lobby has been instrumental in shaping the Trump administration's energy policy.

Another major obstacle is the dominant Economic Growth and Development paradigm, which prioritizes GDP growth above all else. This has led to a myopic focus on short-term economic gains, even if it means sacrificing long-term environmental and social sustainability.

This paradigm has been particularly pronounced in New Zealand, where the Government's commitment to economic growth has led to a range of policies that prioritize the interests of big business and wealthy individuals over those of the environment and ordinary people.

The lack of accountability and transparency is also a major problem. In many countries, including New Zealand, there is a lack of clear, measurable targets for reducing emissions, and a dearth of meaningful accountability mechanisms to ensure that governments are sticking to their promises.

Furthermore, the science itself is often complicated and difficult to communicate to the general public, making it easy for skeptical voices to dominate the debate and for governments to delay or defer action.

So what can be done? The good news is that there are many glimmers of hope on the horizon. In New Zealand, for example, there is a growing movement of activists, businesses, and communities pushing for more urgent and decisive action on climate change.

Around the world, there are many inspiring examples of grass-roots movements, citizen-led initiatives, and community-led projects that are making a real difference in reducing emissions and promoting sustainable development.

At the same time, there are many people and organizations working tirelessly behind the scenes to push for policy changes and legislative reforms that can help to drive progress on climate change.

In New Zealand, for instance, there are calls for a more radical overhaul of the country's energy system, with a focus on transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources.

There are also efforts to strengthen accountability mechanisms and increase transparency around emissions reduction efforts, as well as to promote public engagement and education on climate change.

Of course, there is no shortage of challenges ahead. But the truth is that climate change is not just an environmental issue, it's a human rights issue, an economic issue, and a social justice issue.

Ultimately, it's up to all of us – governments, corporations, civil society, and individuals – to work together to address this crisis. We must listen to the science, take immediate and decisive action, and commit to a sustainable and equitable future for all.
