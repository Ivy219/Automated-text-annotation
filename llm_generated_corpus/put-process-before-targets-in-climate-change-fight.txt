As the world continues to grapple with the devastating impacts of climate change, it's clear that the fight against this global menace requires a fundamental shift in approach. The current focus on setting targets and signing agreements is merely scratching the surface of a much more complex and deeply ingrained issue.

In reality, the primary struggles we face in addressing climate change are not about setting ambitious targets or meeting deadlines, but rather about putting process before targets. We need to shift our focus from the destination to the journey itself, recognizing that the actions we take today will either propel us closer to a safer, more sustainable future or continue to propel us further into the crisis.

The current trajectory of climate action is woefully inadequate. Despite the promising rhetoric of world leaders, the evidence suggests that our efforts are falling woefully short of what's needed to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. The recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for instance, warns that we have only a decade to halve global greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst-case scenarios, yet we're still struggling to meet even our own modest targets.

Politicians and policymakers often tout their climate change efforts as a point of pride, touting targets that are little more than empty promises. The reality is that these targets are frequently based on mere increments of emissions reductions, rather than fundamental transformations of our societies and economies. We've seen this play out in the development of the Paris Agreement, which relies on nation-states setting their own emission reduction targets, with little binding commitment to achieve them.

This approach is fundamentally flawed. Targets, no matter how ambitious, are merely a means to an end. It's the process of achieving these targets that truly matters. Unfortunately, this process has been woefully neglected.

For instance, we've seen a proliferation of greenwashing initiatives, where companies and organizations label themselves as "sustainable" or "environmentally friendly" while continuing to perpetuate business-as-usual practices. We've also seen governments tout investments in renewable energy while simultaneously greenlighting new fossil fuel projects. The result is a superficial veneer of environmental progress that belies ongoing harm to the planet.

Furthermore, the process of addressing climate change is often approached in isolation, without considering the broader societal and economic implications. We've seen instances where climate policies have inadvertently created new barriers to entry for low-income communities or undermined local industries. This must change. Climate action requires a holistic approach that considers the intersection of environmental, social, and economic concerns.

In pursuit of a new approach, we need to focus on process before targets. This means reorienting our efforts around fundamental societal transformations, such as a transition to renewable energy, a shift towards sustainable consumption patterns, and a rewiring of our economic systems to prioritize long-term value over short-term gains.

One promising area of focus is the development of low-carbon infrastructure. Cities and nations are bridging the gap between rhetoric and reality by investing in the construction of green highways, bike lanes, and public transportation systems. This infrastructure is not only crucial for reducing emissions but also for redefining the way we live and interact with one another.

Another critical area of focus is the need to democratize climate action. Decision-making must be taken out of the hands of unelected officials and placed into the hands of the people. This requires empowering communities and marginalized groups to drive climate action, rather than simply being the recipients of handouts or token gestures.

Finally, we must recognize that climate action is not a zero-sum game. It's not a question of pitting one industry or community against another, but rather a collective effort to create a more just, inclusive, and sustainable world.

In conclusion, it's time we refocus our efforts on the process of achieving our climate goals, rather than simply setting targets and signing agreements. We must recognize that the journey itself is the endgame, and that the actions we take today will either propel us closer to a safer, more sustainable future or continue to propel us further into the crisis. It's time we put process before targets, and let the momentum of climate action drive us towards a better world.
