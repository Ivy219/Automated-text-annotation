As the clock ticks closer to a global deadline, the threat of climate change continues to dominate headlines and minds around the world. The ongoing existential threat is undeniable, and experts warn that it's a ticking time bomb that could have devastating consequences if left unchecked. In the face of this crisis, many are wondering: what role do corporate directors play in addressing this crisis, and should they be held accountable if they fail to take action?

For decades, companies have been operating under the assumption that profits come before purpose. The emphasis has been on maximizing shareholder value, often at the expense of the planet and its inhabitants. However, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warning that nations have just over a decade to take drastic action to prevent catastrophic damage, the concept of responsible capitalism is being reexamined.

Many argue that directors who ignore climate change risks are not only shirking their duty but also putting their company's future at risk. As the world's largest economies commit to net-zero emissions goals, the pressure is on corporate leaders to pivot towards sustainable practices. In theory, this shift should benefit both the environment and the bottom line, as innovations in clean energy and sustainable technologies create new revenue streams.

Yet, despite the rhetoric, many companies continue to prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. This lack of action has serious consequences, as a recent study revealed that three-quarters of companies with significant carbon footprints have not disclosed their emissions levels to investors. The lack of transparency and accountability allows corporations to sidestep responsibility and continue down the path of environmental destruction.

In New Zealand, this issue has received increased attention in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the country's transition towards a low-carbon economy, but many argue that the pace of change is still insufficient. The Government has set ambitious targets to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Meanwhile, companies like Fonterra, Spark, and Air New Zealand have made commitments to reduce their carbon footprint, but critics argue that these promises lack teeth.

Some have called for the government to take a more active role in holding corporate directors accountable for their inaction on climate change. This could involve introducing new laws and regulations to ensure that companies prioritize sustainability and transparency. Others recommend that investors and consumers take a more active role in pushing companies to adopt environmentally responsible practices.

As pressure mounts, some notable directors have begun to speak out, acknowledging the urgent need for change. For instance, in 2020, the CEO of the global company Unilever announced that the company would eliminate its use of fossil fuels in the production of its products. This move was seen as a significant step towards a more sustainable future, as Unilever's operations fueled over 2.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.

However, many question the authenticity of these declarations. Do they merely represent a public relations exercise, designed to appease an increasingly concerned public, rather than a genuine commitment to change? Critics point to the countless promises made by corporations over the years, only to be broken or quietly abandoned when the going gets tough.

It is essential to acknowledge that the transformation to a low-carbon economy is a complex and challenging process. For many businesses, it will require significant investments in new technologies, processes, and infrastructure. However, as climate change continues to escalate, the need for bold action is clearer than ever.

The question remains: should directors who ignore climate change risks keep their jobs? The answer lies in the actions they take in the coming years. Will they prioritize profits over purpose, or will they recognize the urgency of the crisis and take concrete steps towards a more sustainable future? As a society, we demand accountability and transparency from our leaders, and it is time for corporate directors to step up and answer the call.

Ultimately, the fate of our planet depends on it. Climate change is a global problem requiring unified global action. As the stakes continue to rise, it is essential that we hold our leaders accountable, starting with the corporate directors who are supposed to guide these organizations towards a more sustainable future.

In the face of an existential crisis, the status quo is no longer an acceptable option. It is time for corporate directors to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and take concrete steps towards a more sustainable tomorrow. Anything less would be a betrayal of trust and a failure to prioritize the well-being of both people and the planet.
