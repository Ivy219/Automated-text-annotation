In a landmark decision, the Whanganui District Court has ruled that a prominent iwi leader has the right to sue major polluters for their role in causing climate change.

Iwi leader Tamati Reedy, who represents the Ngāti Tūwharetoa iwi, had launched the lawsuit against 31 of the world's largest polluters, including some of the biggest carbon emitters in the world, such as coal companies and oil refineries. Reedy argued that these companies have been aware of the dangers of climate change for decades, but have chosen to prioritize profits over the well-being of future generations.

Reedy's lawyer, Nick Wright, said the court's decision was a significant victory for the iwi and for the future of the planet. "This is a major breakthrough for indigenous communities and for the fight against climate change," Wright said. "For too long, these companies have been able to pollute and profit without any accountability. Today, the court has said that that is no longer the case."

The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019, alleges that the polluters have caused irreparable harm to the iwi's ancestral lands and cultural practices. The iwi relies heavily on the Whanganui River, which is considered a taonga (treasure) by the community, for its spiritual and cultural significance. However, the river is being threatened by climate change, which is causing rising temperatures, more frequent droughts, and increased flooding.

Reedy said that the iwi is not seeking compensation for past harm, but rather wants to ensure that the polluters take action to reduce their emissions and prevent further harm. "We are not trying to punish these companies, but rather we are trying to hold them accountable for their actions," Reedy said. "We want them to take responsibility for the damage they have caused and to work with us to find solutions to this global problem."

The court's decision was made public on Wednesday, and Reedy has welcomed the ruling as a significant step forward for the iwi. "This is a major victory for our iwi and for the Whanganui River," Reedy said. "We are proud to have taken a stand against the polluters and to have held them accountable for their actions. We will continue to work towards a sustainable future for our community and for the planet."

The ruling has been met with widespread support from environmental groups and indigenous communities around the world. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said the decision was a "major breakthrough" and hailed Reedy as a "pioneer" in the fight against climate change. "This decision sends a strong message to polluters around the world that they will be held accountable for their actions," said WWF-New Zealand spokesperson, Alex Lis.
"Indigenous communities are disproportionately affected by climate change, and this ruling acknowledges their rights and their knowledge as a key part of the solution. We hope this decision will inspire more actions like this and ultimately contribute to the global effort to address the climate crisis."

Reedy's lawyer, Wright, said that the court's decision sets an important precedent for future lawsuits. "This ruling shows that indigenous communities have a right to hold polluters accountable and that they have a critical role to play in the fight against climate change," Wright said. "We hope that this decision will inspire other communities to take action and to hold polluters to account."

The court's decision comes as the world's governments prepare to meet at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow later this year. The summit is expected to bring together leaders from around the world to discuss their plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

In the meantime, Reedy's iwi is continuing to work with the New Zealand government to develop a climate change strategy that prioritizes the well-being of indigenous communities. The strategy, which is expected to be finalized later this year, will focus on reducing emissions, protecting biodiversity, and supporting indigenous communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Reedy said that the strategy is an important step forward for the country, but that it must be backed up by action. "We need to see more than just words from the government – we need to see action on the ground," Reedy said. "We need to see a reduction in emissions, and we need to see support for indigenous communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change."

In conclusion, the court's decision is a significant victory for the iwi and for the fight against climate change. It sends a strong message to polluters around the world that they will be held accountable for their actions and acknowledges the critical role that indigenous communities must play in the fight against climate change. As the world prepares for the COP26 summit, Reedy's iwi will continue to work towards a sustainable future for their community and for the planet.
