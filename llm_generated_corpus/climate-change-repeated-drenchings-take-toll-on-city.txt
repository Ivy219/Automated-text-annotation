Wellingtonians are reeling from the cumulative effects of climate change and repeated drenchings, which have seen the city's infrastructure, economy, and residents struggling to cope.

The past year has been one of the wettest on record for Wellington, with 1,300 hours of rainfall since January, surpassing the previous record of 1,200 hours set in 2014. This excessive rain has led to widespread flooding, landslides, and damage to homes and businesses, causing devastation for those affected.

For residents, the constant rain has become the norm, making it difficult to plan and enjoy everyday activities. "It's been a real challenge," said Sarah Jenkins, a mother of two. "My kids can't even play in the backyard anymore because it's always soggy and muddy. We're desperate for a dry weekend."

The city's infrastructure has also taken a battering. The kerbs and gutters are constantly overflowing, causing flooding in streets and homes. "It's like a never-ending battle," said Council spokesperson, John Smith. "We've been working day and night to clear the drains, but it's a losing battle when the rain just keeps coming."

The economic impact is also being felt, with many businesses struggling to cope with the effects of the rain. "It's devastating," said local shop owner, Emma Martin. "I've had customers cancelling orders, and my suppliers can't deliver because of the flooding. It's hard to keep going when it feels like the odds are against you."

Climate change is being cited as a major contributor to the repeated drenchings, with experts warning of more extreme weather events in the future. "Climate change is already having a significant impact on our region, and we can expect to see more frequent and intense weather events like these," said Dr. Jane Smith, a climate scientist at Victoria University. "It's essential that we take action now to mitigate the effects and adapt to the new climate reality."

To address the issue, the city council has implemented various measures, including installing flood-control measures, upgrading stormwater infrastructure, and promoting sustainable practices. However, more needs to be done to address the root cause of the problem â€“ climate change.

In the meantime, residents are finding ways to adapt to the new reality. Many are embracing the soggy conditions, with some even starting up businesses selling rain-related products, such as waterproof umbrellas and rain boots. Others are taking advantage of the wet weather to engage in activities like kayaking and fishing.

Despite the challenges, Wellingtonians are known for their resilience and determination. As one resident quipped, "It's not the rain that's the problem, it's the attitude. We'll get through this, just like we always do."

However, as the city faces an uncertain future, it's clear that something needs to change. The constant rain is taking a toll on the city's morale, and it's time for action to be taken to address the root cause of the problem.
