As the effects of climate change continue to accumulate, the urgency of addressing this global crisis has reached a boiling point. In the wake of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which warned that time is running out to prevent catastrophic tipping points, the call for collective action has become louder than ever.

In New Zealand, the onus is on our leaders to make a unified stand against the scourge of climate change. It's a challenge that requires the help of every corner of society, from government and industry to community groups and individuals. The stakes couldn't be higher, as we face the very real risk of rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and irreparable damage to our planet.

The science is clear: human activities are releasing record levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, at an alarming rate. The consequences are far-reaching, from melting glaciers and sea-level rise to more intense heatwaves, droughts, and storms. The window for action is rapidly closing, and the IPCC warning that we need to cut emissions by 45% by 2030 to avoid catastrophic consequences only serves to underscore the gravity of the situation.

Locally, the picture is equally dire. Rising sea levels threaten our coastal communities, while more frequent heavy rainfall events, like those experienced recently in the North Island, put people and infrastructure at risk. The business community, too, is feeling the impact of climate change, with increasing costs for insurance, energy, and supply chains.

Given this backdrop, it's essential that our leaders work together to create a cohesive and science-based approach to addressing the crisis. The government's own climate change bill provides a framework, but it's crucial that it's translated into concrete action and tangible progress.

One area where unity is essential is in the development of a comprehensive and just transition plan for our energy sector. We cannot afford to continue relying on fossil fuels, which account for a significant portion of our emissions. Meanwhile, the potential of renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar, has never been greater. A collaborative effort to develop and deploy these technologies could not only reduce emissions but also create new job opportunities and stimulate local economies.

Another critical front is in the area of transportation. As our cities continue to grow and urban areas become more congested, the need for an effective public transportation network has never been more pressing. Electric buses, for instance, can greatly reduce emissions while providing a reliable and efficient means of getting people around our cities. A coordinated approach to solving this puzzle would require input from local government, the private sector, and the community.

A further challenge is addressing the disconnect between public awareness and government action on climate change. While there's been progress in raising awareness, there's no denying that many New Zealanders remain unconvinced about the urgency of the issue. It's essential that our leaders engage with the public on a level that's transparent, accessible, and encouraging. By emphasizing the co-benefits of climate action, such as improved air quality, more jobs in the renewable energy sector, and even enhanced food security, we can create a more inclusive and participatory approach to addressing the crisis.

The Forum on Climate Change, which will take place in the coming months, presents an unparalleled opportunity for our leaders to come together and chart a united course of action. The event must be seen as a signal moment in our nation's response to the climate crisis. By making a collective commitment to take bold and decisive action, we can demonstrate to the world that New Zealand is serious about meeting the challenge of climate change.

In the words of the IPCC, "asset compounding" – where initial climate change is compounded by later changes – will have devastating consequences unless we act. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to take the necessary steps to reduce emissions, develop sustainable infrastructure, and create a just and inclusive transition. The time for division and complacency is over; the time for unity and action has arrived.

As we move forward, it's crucial that we not only acknowledge the science but also listen to the concerns and ideas of those most affected by climate change. From Māori leaders calling for greater support for their communities to young people demanding urgent action, the voices of those on the frontline must be amplified and prioritized.

In the face of such an overwhelming challenge, it's heartening to see that across New Zealand, individuals and communities are already rising to the occasion. From school strike activists to businesses embracing sustainable practices, the groundswell of support for climate action is palpable. We must harness this energy and channel it into a unified and effective response to the climate crisis.

We cannot afford to procrastinate in the face of such an existential threat. Climate change demands unity, and we must meet this challenge head-on. The future of our planet, and our own future, depend on it.
