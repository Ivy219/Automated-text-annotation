As the world grapples with the urgent need to address the rapid pace of climate change, experts are highlighting the transportation sector as a key area for immediate action. With the sector accounting for nearly a third of New Zealand's total greenhouse gas emissions, tackling transport emissions is crucial for meeting the country's 2030 climate goals.

According to a recent report by the Ministry for the Environment, transport emissions have been increasing steadily over the past decade, driven by the growth in light vehicles, freight, and aviation. In 2019, transport emissions reached a record high, with 94.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emitted.

"The transport sector is a significant contributor to our greenhouse gas emissions, and it's an area where we can make a meaningful impact," said Dr. Ian Town, a transport emissions expert at the University of Canterbury. "We need to focus on reducing emissions from existing vehicles, as well as shifting towards more sustainable modes of transport."

One of the key areas of focus is the rapid uptake of electric vehicles (EVs). With the government setting a target of 1.5 million EVs on New Zealand's roads by 2035, public and private sector investment in EV charging infrastructure is expected to surge. In fact, the Ministry of Transport has announced a plan to fund the installation of 1,000 new public charging stations across the country.

"The charging infrastructure is a critical enabler for the transition to electric vehicles," said Toby Garbett, the CEO of ChargeNet, a company specializing in EV charging solutions. "Without it, people won't be able to charge their vehicles on the go, and they won't be able to switch from petrol to electric. We're seeing a huge demand for charge points, and we're working with the government to ensure get it right."

Another area of focus is the development of alternative fuels. In a bid to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, the government has committed to introducing a $30 million per annum Biofuels Funding Fund, which will support the production of low-carbon fuels like bioethanol and biobutanol.

"We're seeing some exciting developments in biofuels, particularly in the production of advanced biofuels," said Dr. Antonia George, a biofuels expert at the University of Waikato. "These fuels have the potential to reduce emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional petrol, and they're compatible with existing vehicles. We're working closely with industry partners to commercialize these technologies and get them into the market."

Another critical area is the expansion of public transport options. With the country's population expected to grow by 1.3 million by 2038, government and private sector investment in public transport is essential for reducing reliance on personal vehicles and reducing emissions.

"The growth in public transport is all about creating a sustainable and efficient transport system," said Auckland Transport's acting CEO, Mark grave. "We're investing heavily in new buses, upgrading our fleet, and introducing new services to make public transport a viable option for more people. We're also working with the government to develop a comprehensive public transport network that connects our cities and towns."

However, despite the progress being made, experts warn that more needs to be done to address the elephant in the room – the growth in light vehicle emissions. With 70% of the country's light vehicle stock expected to still be emitting fossil fuels by 2035, the government is being urged to implement stricter emissions standards and phase out internal combustion engines.

"The growth in light vehicle emissions is a major challenge," said Dr. Andrew Barrow, an energy expert at the University of Auckland. "We need to be upfront with the public about the need for change and implement policies that encourage the adoption of low-emission vehicles. The government needs to set a clear plan for phasing out fossil fuels and provide support for manufacturers and consumers to make the transition."

New Zealand is not alone in its efforts to address transport emissions. Globally, governments are waging a war on transport emissions, with countries like Norway, the UK, and the US introducing stricter emissions standards and incentivizing the adoption of electric vehicles.

As the transportation sector continues to evolve, one thing is clear – the status quo is no longer an option. With the OECD predicting that transport emissions will rise by 45% by 2050 if no action is taken, it's imperative that governments and industry leaders work together to address the transport emissions challenge head-on.

"It's a matter of when, not if," said Dr. Ian Town. "We need to act now to reduce transport emissions and meet our climate goals. The benefits will be felt not just in terms of reduced emissions, but also in terms of improved air quality, reduced congestion, and a more sustainable future for our country."
