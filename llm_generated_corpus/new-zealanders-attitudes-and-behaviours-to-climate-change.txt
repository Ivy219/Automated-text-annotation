As the world grapples with the increasing threat of climate change, New Zealand is no exception. Here, amidst the rolling hills and pristine beaches, the nation is grappling with its own role in mitigating the effects of global warming. In recent years, the country has seen a significant shift in the way citizens think about climate change, with many becoming more vocal about its impact and the urgent need for action.

According to a recent survey conducted by Stats NZ, nearly 80% of New Zealanders consider climate change a serious issue, with over 60% citing it as a top priority for the government. This growing awareness has led to some notable changes in the way Kiwis view themselves as part of the climate solution, with many adopting sustainable practices and calling for more immediate action.

In the wake of the 2019 general election, the newly elected Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, made climate change a top priority, pledging to reduce New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050. The government has since introduced a range of policies aimed at reducing emissions, including a carbon pricing scheme, increased funding for renewable energy projects, and incentives for electric vehicle adoption.

This shift in government policy has had a palpable impact on the public's attitude towards climate change. For many, the sense of urgency has translated into tangible actions, from reducing energy consumption to making conscious consumption choices. In Auckland, for example, a growing number of residents are embracing the "slow down" lifestyle, with some opting to ditch their daily commutes in favor of cycling or walking.

"It's amazing what some small changes can do," says Auckland resident and climate activist, Emily Chen. "I used to commute hours to work every day, but since switching to electric biking, I've saved not just my carbon footprint, but also my sleep pattern and overall well-being. It's a small step, but every little bit counts, right?"

As the issue of climate change gains greater traction, so too has the debate around the role of individual actions versus government policies. While some argue that citizens should cast their concerns aside and leave the heavy lifting to policymakers, others contend that personal choices are often the most immediate and impactful ways to make a difference.

For New Zealand's small business owners, Balancing the two approaches can be a delicate tightrope act. For those in the hospitality industry, for example, finding ways to reduce waste and energy consumption is becoming increasingly important. "Customers are becoming more and more prepared to pay a premium for sustainable practices," notes Emma Watson, owner of popular Wellington café, "and honestly, it's the right thing to do. Every little bit counts, and if we can help with just one or two of their daily decisions, it's a start."

In addition to policy changes and individual actions, a quiet revolution is taking place amidst New Zealand's tertiary education sector.
