In a shocking revelation, it has emerged that millions of dollars have been spent on private claims related to climate change, leading to concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability in the way climate-related damages are addressed.

According to recently released figures, the New Zealand government has paid out millions of dollars over the past decade to individuals and companies who have made claims related to climate change. The majority of these claims have been related to agricultural losses, property damage, and health issues caused by climate-related extreme weather events.

However, what is most striking is the fact that the majority of these claims have been made outside of the public eye, with many individuals and companies opting to pursue private settlements rather than going through the official government compensation process.

Experts suggest that this lack of transparency and accountability is a major concern, as it creates a system where those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change are left to fight for compensation in a complex and often expensive legal system.

"We are seeing a scenario where those who are most affected by climate change are being left to fend for themselves, while those with deeper pockets are able to claim significant sums of money," said Dr. Sophia Ng, a climate change expert at the University of Auckland. "It's not fair and it's not sustainable."

The figures, which are based on data obtained through the Official Information Act, show that in the past decade, the government has paid out over $20 million in private settlements related to climate change. However, it is believed that this number is likely to be much higher, as many claims are not publicly disclosed.

The majority of these claims have been related to agricultural losses, with many farmers and growers seeking compensation for damage caused by extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and storms.

One such farmer, who wished to remain anonymous, told the NZ Herald that they had made a claim for $1 million in damages after their farm was severely impacted by a severe drought in early 2018.

"I had spent years building my farm and my livestock, and then this drought came along and wiped it all out," they said. "I had no choice but to make a claim, and I was lucky to get a payout of $200,000. But I know others who have been left high and dry."

Other claims have been related to property damage and health issues caused by climate-related extreme weather events. For example, a group of residents from the Hawke's Bay region, who were impacted by a severe flood in 2020, made a claim for $1 million in damages after their homes were left uninhabitable.

"We were left with thousands of dollars in damage, and no help from the government," said one resident. "We had to pay for repairs out of our own pockets, and it's been a huge financial burden."

Experts suggest that the lack of transparency and accountability in the way climate-related damages are addressed is a major concern, as it creates a system where those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change are left to fight for compensation in a complex and often expensive legal system.

"It's a classic case of those who are most affected by climate change being left to fight for scraps, while those with deeper pockets are able to get away with it," said Dr. Ng. "It's not fair and it's not sustainable."

The government has responded to concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability by announcing plans to establish a new climate change compensation system.

"We recognize that climate change is having a significant impact on our country, and we are committed to doing what we can to support those who are affected," said a government spokesperson. "We believe that a new compensation system will help to simplify the process for claimants and provide more transparency and accountability."

However, critics suggest that the plan does not go far enough, and that more needs to be done to address the lack of transparency and accountability in the way climate-related damages are addressed.

"We welcome the government's announcement, but we believe that more needs to be done," said Dr. Ng. "We need a system that is transparent, accountable, and fair. Anything less is unacceptable."

As the climate continues to change and extreme weather events become more frequent, the need for a clear and effective compensation system has never been more pressing. It remains to be seen whether the government's plans will be enough to address the lack of transparency and accountability in the way climate-related damages are addressed, and whether justice will be served for those who are most affected by this global crisis.
