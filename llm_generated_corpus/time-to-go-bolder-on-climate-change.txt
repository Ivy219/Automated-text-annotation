The stark reality of climate change is no longer a distant threat, but a present-day reality that is having a profound impact on our country. Rising temperatures, more frequent and severe weather events, and changing precipitation patterns are just a few of the consequences that are being felt across New Zealand.

As the effects of climate change continue to escalate, it is imperative that we take bold and immediate action to mitigate its impacts. This requires a shift in our collective mindset, from one of incremental progress to a comprehensive and ambitious approach that addresses the root causes of this crisis.

The science is clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to a global average temperature increase of over 1Â°C since the late 1800s. This warming is melting glaciers, raising sea levels, and altering ecosystems, with far-reaching consequences for our environment, economy, and society.

In New Zealand, we are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. Rising temperatures are altering the distribution and abundance of native species, while more frequent droughts and floods are threatening our agricultural sector and urban infrastructure. The increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as the recent droughts and bushfires, are also taking a devastating toll on our communities.

The time for denial or complacency is over. We must recognize that climate change is not just an environmental issue, but a humanitarian crisis that demands a coordinated response from governments, businesses, and individuals. The science is clear, and the evidence is mounting: climate change is a pressing threat to our collective future.

So, what does a bolder approach to climate change look like? First and foremost, it requires a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050 or sooner. This can be achieved through a range of measures, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and implementing policies to promote sustainable land use and transportation.

New Zealand has made significant progress in recent years, with the establishment of the Climate Change Response Act and the creation of the Zero Carbon Act. However, more needs to be done to achieve the necessary level of ambition. This includes increasing the carbon price, expanding renewable energy generation, and investing in carbon capture and storage technologies.

Another critical component of a bolder approach is addressing the issue of emissions from agriculture. The agricultural sector is responsible for around 30% of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions, largely due to the production of livestock and dairy products. This requires a shift towards more sustainable agricultural practices, such as rotational grazing, afforestation, and the use of precision agriculture technologies.

The business community also has a critical role to play in addressing climate change. Many companies are already taking bold action, investing in renewable energy, reducing energy consumption, and adopting sustainable supply chain practices. However, more needs to be done to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Individuals also have a critical role to play. We can all make a difference by reducing our own carbon footprint, adopting sustainable lifestyle choices, and advocating for climate action. This includes using public transport, carpooling, and cycling, as well as reducing food waste, using energy-efficient appliances, and supporting renewable energy projects.

A bolder approach to climate change also requires a shift in our values and priorities. We need to recognize that the climate crisis is a global issue that requires international cooperation and collective action. We need to put the needs of future generations ahead of short-term economic interests and prioritize the well-being of the planet.

In New Zealand, this requires a shift in our economic model, from one that is based on exploiting natural resources to one that is based on sustainable development and the protection of our natural assets. This includes investing in renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure, and eco-tourism, as well as promoting sustainable agriculture and forestry practices.

A bolder approach to climate change also requires a more proactive approach to disaster risk reduction and management. This includes investing in early warning systems, disaster preparedness, and climate-resilient infrastructure, as well as providing support to communities that are disproportionately affected by climate-related disasters.

In conclusion, the time for incremental progress on climate change is over. We must take bold and immediate action to address the root causes of this crisis and ensure a sustainable future for our country. This requires a shift in our collective mindset, from one of complacency to one of urgency and ambition. It requires a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, addressing emissions from agriculture, and promoting sustainable development. It requires a shift in our values and priorities, from one that prioritizes short-term economic interests to one that prioritizes the well-being of the planet.

The challenge ahead is daunting, but it is not insurmountable. With a bold and collective approach, we can overcome the challenges of climate change and build a sustainable future for our country. The time to act is now.
