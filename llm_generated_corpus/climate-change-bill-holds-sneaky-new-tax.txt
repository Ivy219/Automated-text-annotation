In a move that has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Reform) Amendment Bill, passed its first reading in Parliament earlier this month. While touted as a crucial step towards reducing New Zealand's carbon footprint, many are calling foul over a subtle yet significant clause that effectively imposes a new tax on citizens.

The bill's primary focus is on reforming the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to curb climate change. Under the proposed reforms, the government intends to increase the use of the scheme, making it a key tool in reducing emissions and meeting our Paris Agreement targets. However, buried deep within the legislation is a provision that many argue constitutes a tax on Kiwis without their consent.

Clause 35 of the bill establishes a "Net-Zero" fund, which will be financed by allocating a significant portion of the revenue generated by the ETS. This fund aims to support households and businesses in their transition to a low-emissions economy, particularly those disproportionately affected by climate change, such as those living in coastal areas or engaged in industries that are heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

While the intentions behind the Net-Zero fund are admirable, opponents argue that the fund is essentially a thinly veiled tax on New Zealanders. They point out that the revenue allocated to the fund will come from the same emissions permits that are already sold to companies, including those operating in the agriculture, energy, and industrial sectors.

"A tax on everything and everyone" is how Dr. Arthur Graville, an economics lecturer at the University of Auckland, described the move. "By allocating revenue from the ETS to this fund, the government is essentially imposing a tax on all goods and services that require energy or have a carbon footprint. This could include everything from the food on our tables to the clothes on our backs."

Dr. Graville notes that while the ETS was originally designed as a market-based mechanism to reduce emissions, the allocation of revenue to the Net-Zero fund undermines this principle. "Instead of leaving companies to decide how to reduce their emissions, the government is dictating how they should use their own money to mitigate climate change. This goes against the spirit of a free market economy and is fundamentally unfair to businesses that are already operating on thin margins."

Another major concern is that the revenue generated by the ETS will disproportionately affect low-to-middle-income households. According to a recent study by the New Zealand Initiative, the ETS could increase costs for low-income households by up to $700 per year. "This will disproportionately affect vulnerable communities who already struggle to make ends meet," says Dr. Jane Thompson, an expert in energy and environmental economics. "It's unacceptable that the government is imposing yet another financial burden on those who can least afford it."

Opponents of the bill are calling for the government to repeal Clause 35 and instead establish a separate and transparent funding mechanism for the Net-Zero fund. They argue that this would ensure that the fund is truly ring-fenced and used for its intended purpose, rather than being subject to the vagaries of the ETS revenue.

Environmental groups, however, are adamant that the bill is a necessary step towards reducing emissions and meeting our climate change commitments. They argue that the ETS has been successful in reducing emissions, and that allocating revenue to the Net-Zero fund is a crucial step towards supporting communities in their transition to a low-carbon economy.

"This bill is a major step forward in our fight against climate change," says Kennedy Graham, co-leader of the Green Party. "The Net-Zero fund will provide critical support to communities that need it most, helping them to adapt to the impacts of climate change and transition to a more sustainable economy."

As the bill progresses through Parliament, many are urging MPs to pay close attention to Clause 35 and ensure that the interests of Kiwis are represented. With the stakes so high and the climate crisis pressing, it is more important than ever that our representatives make informed and responsible decisions on behalf of the public.

In the words of Dr. Graville, "Climate change is a complex issue that requires nuanced and considered policy-making. We must avoid knee-jerk reactions and ensure that any legislation is grounded in evidence and fairness."
