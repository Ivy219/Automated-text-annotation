As the world grapples with the impacts of climate change, a new force has emerged on the horizon: king tides. These powerful, record-breaking tidal events are reshaping coastlines, flooding homes, and forcing communities to adapt to a new reality.

In New Zealand, king tides have become an increasingly common occurrence, as sea levels continue to rise at an alarming rate. According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), the average sea level around New Zealand has risen by around 10mm per year over the past 20 years. This may seem small, but the cumulative effect is already being felt, with more frequent and intense flooding events affecting communities nationwide.

One of the most heavily impacted areas is the Bay of Plenty, where a record-breaking king tide in 2020 inundated parts of Tauranga and Auckland. The floods caused widespread disruptions, with thousands of people forced to evacuate their homes and businesses. The economic cost was estimated in the millions, as infrastructure and property suffered significant damage.

Communities in the region are no strangers to flooding, but even they were surprised by the ferocity of the king tide. For residents like local pensioner, Jessie Wilson, the experience was a wake-up call. "I've lived in this area all my life, and I've never seen anything like it," Jessie said. "The water just kept rising and rising, and before we knew it, we were thigh-deep in water. It was surreal, but also terrifying."

Tauranga City Council has since been working alongside residents to develop a coastal plan, aimed at mitigating the impacts of king tides and future flooding. The plan includes measures such as enhanced drainage systems, upgraded flood gates, and land-use changes to reduce the risk of property damage.

While Tauranga is one of the worst-affected areas, it's by no means the only region experiencing the effects of king tides. Communities around the country, from Whangarei to Dunedin, are all facing similar challenges.

The science behind king tides is straightforward: as Earth's climate continues to warm, sea levels are rising due to melting glaciers and the thermal expansion of seawater. This, combined with the natural gravitational pull of the moon, causes the ocean to bulge, resulting in higher-than-usual tides.

However, the human toll is what makes king tides so concerning. For many, the impacts are not just economic or environmental, but personal and emotional as well. "I've seen people's homes destroyed, livelihoods lost, and families displaced," said Dr. Danielle Svangard, a coastal resilience expert from NIWA. "It's not just the physical damage – it's the trauma and stress associated with surviving a king tide. We need to acknowledge the human cost and work towards adapting our communities to reduce the impacts."

So, what can be done to mitigate the effects of king tides? Experts say it's a multi-pronged approach that involves a mix of engineering solutions, coastal management, and community-led initiatives.

In terms of engineering, derived from Dutch expertise, is the concept of "flood-resistant design." Essentially, this means building infrastructure and buildings that can withstand flooding conditions, often through the use of elevated foundations, flood-proof doors, and impermeable materials.

Coastal management is another area where New Zealand can learn from others. For instance, the Netherlands' iconic dikes and levees have been elevated and reinforced to better withstand sea level rise. Similarly, the US Army Corps of Engineers has been designing and constructing new coastal defenses to protect major cities like Miami and New York.

In terms of community-led initiatives, there's a growing emphasis on education, awareness, and preparedness. This includes regular sea level rise projections, public events to raise awareness, and emergency response planning. In California, for example, new regulations require coastal communities to develop climate-resilience plans and conduct regular erosion mapping.

Back in Tauranga, residents are already seeing the benefits of a proactive approach. Jessie Wilson, the pensioner who was forced to evacuate her home during the record-breaking king tide, is now an advocate for coastal resilience. "I want to help others prepare for the next one," she said. "We need to work together to find solutions – we can't just sit back and wait for the waters to rise."

As king tides continue to reshape the nation's coastline, it's clear that the future will be shaped by these powerful events. Will New Zealand rise to the challenge, and adapt to the new reality? Or will we continue to be battered by the forces of nature? Only time will tell.
