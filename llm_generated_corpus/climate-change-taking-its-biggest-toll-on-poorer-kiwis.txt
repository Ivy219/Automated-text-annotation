As the effects of climate change continue to ravage the planet, a worrying trend has emerged in New Zealand: the disproportionate impact it is having on poorer Kiwis. A recent study by the University of Auckland has shed light on the stark reality facing those who are already struggling to make ends meet.

According to the research, households earning less than $50,000 a year are significantly more vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to their limited financial resources and lack of access to climate-resilient infrastructure. This includes lower-income households living in flood-prone areas, who are not just facing the physical consequences of rising sea levels, but also the financial burden of repairing or rebuilding damaged homes.

One of the most vulnerable groups is the elderly, many of whom are on fixed incomes that are struggling to keep pace with the ever-growing costs of living. For instance, a 75-year-old retiree living in a flood-prone area of Auckland's southern suburbs, such as Otahuhu or Panmure, may be faced with the daunting task of adapting their home to withstand the increasing frequency and severity of floods, a task that could be financially crippling.

Worse still, the poor are also more likely to experience food insecurity and other essential item shortages, which are exacerbated by climate-related disruptions to supply chains and harvests. A survey conducted by the Auckland City Mission found that one in five people in Auckland reported struggling to afford groceries, with food insecurity particularly affecting single-parent families and those with low incomes.

Moreover, the impacts of climate change are also being felt in the realm of mental health, with the constant stress and uncertainty causing immense anxiety for those living in areas prone to natural disasters. A study by Massey University found that nearly one-quarter of New Zealanders reported experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression, with the impact of climate change being exacerbated by social isolation and feelings of powerlessness.

Furthermore, the poor are often forced to live in areas with inadequate infrastructure, which is less prepared to withstand the increased extreme weather events, making them more susceptible to the physical and economic impacts of climate change. For instance, the low-lying coastal areas of Wellington, such as WaiwhetÅ«, are particularly prone to flooding, and the residents in this area are more likely to experience the devastating consequences of climate change, such as damaged homes, lost livelihoods, and disrupted daily routines.

Government officials have acknowledged the need for greater support and priority to be given to vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of climate change. In response, the Government has launched an initiative aimed at providing assistance to households affected by natural disasters, including funding for repairs and reconstruction, as well as support for mental health and wellbeing.

However, many argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of this issue, such as poverty and inequality. Restructuring the economy and addressing social and political inequalities are crucial steps towards building a more resilient and adaptive society.

A recent report by the Human Rights Commission called on the Government to take a more holistic approach, linking climate action with poverty reduction and social and economic inequality reduction. According to the report, addressing these underlying issues would not only reduce the social and economic impacts of climate change but also help build a more just and equitable society.

As the arms of climate change continue to encroach on our backyard, it is clear that the poor cannot be left behind. We must rally together to support those who are struggling the most and acknowledge that climate change is not just an environmental issue, but also a human rights imperative.

However, addressing this crisis is not just a matter of goodwill; it requires a comprehensive plan that integrates climate action with poverty reduction, social and economic inequality, and human rights. Only then can we truly ensure that everyone can adapt to the changing climate and build a more just and resilient society for all.
